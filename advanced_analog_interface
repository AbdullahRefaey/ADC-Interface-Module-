This advanced analog interface module has five input and output ports:

clk: This is the clock input, which is used to synchronize the operation of the advanced analog interface.
rst: This is the reset input, which is used to reset the internal state of the advanced analog interface.
analog_in: This is an input port that is used to receive the external analog signal. The analog_in port is a 16-bit port, so it can receive a 16-bit analog input.
analog_out: This is an output port that is used to transfer the sampled analog signal to the rest of the system.
adc_rdy: This is an output port that is used to indicate when the advanced analog interface is ready to transfer data. When adc_rdy is 1, the advanced analog interface is ready to transfer the sampled analog signal to the analog_out output port.
The module uses a finite state machine (FSM) to control the sampling and transfer of the analog signal. The FSM has three states: IDLE, SAMPLING, and `DATA_TRANSFER

This module is to store the output of the analog interface module in a FIFO. The analog interface module with FIFO is a modified version of the analog interface module that was provided in the previous answer. 
The main difference is that this module has a FIFO buffer that can store the sampled analog signal before it is transferred to the rest of the system.

It has seven input and output ports:
clk: This is the clock input, which is used to synchronize the operation of the module.
rst: This is the reset input, which is used to reset the internal state of the module.
analog_in: This is an input port that is used to receive the external analog signal.
analog_out: This is an output port that is used to transfer the sampled analog signal to the rest of the system.
adc_rdy: This is an output port that is used to indicate when the module is ready to transfer data.
fifo_empty: This is an output port that is used to indicate whether the FIFO buffer is empty or not.
fifo_write_en: This is an input port that is used to enable writing to the FIFO buffer.
fifo_data_in: This is an output port that is used to write the sampled analog signal to the FIFO buffer.
The module has an internal state machine that controls the flow of data. When the module is idle, it waits for a new sample to be available. 
When a new sample is available, it is stored in the sample_reg register and the state machine transitions to the data transfer state. 
In the data transfer state, the sampled analog signal is transferred to the analog_out output port and to the FIFO buffer (if fifo_write_en is 1). 
Finally, the state machine returns to the idle state and waits for the next sample.
